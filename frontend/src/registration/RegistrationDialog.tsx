                During two weeks, from Monday (2018-10-15) to Sunday (2018-10-28), you will be asked to log in to this website four times a day. To make this as simple as possible, you will receive reminders by email with links for logging in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Logging in is done using a password and a pattern that you will assign in the next steps. As the purpose of the study is to compare login methods for mobile phones, please log in using your mobile phone.
